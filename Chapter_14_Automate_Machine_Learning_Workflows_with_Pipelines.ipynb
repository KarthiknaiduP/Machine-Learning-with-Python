The pipeline provides a handy tool called the FeatureUnion which allows the results of multiple feature selection and extraction procedures to be combined into a larger dataset on which a model can be trained. Importantly, all the feature extraction and the feature union occurs within each fold of the cross validation procedure. The example below demonstrates the pipeline defined with four steps:\n",
